# armorpaint_blender

Blender add-on for ArmorPaint. Fork of the awesome [Blender-ArmorPaintLiveLink](https://github.com/PiloeGAO/Blender-ArmorPaintLiveLink) repo by PiloeGAO with the goal to keep it under active development.

- Get ArmorPaint 0.9 and Blender 3.6
- Download `armorpaint_blender.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/armory3d/armorpaint_blender/releases)
- Extract `armorpaint_blender.zip`
- In Blender, press *Edit > Preferences... > Add-ons > Install...* and select the `armorpaint_livelink.py` file
- Turn on the add-on
- Point the `ArmorPaint Executable` field to your ArmorPaint binary
- In the 3D View, open the side panel (*N* shortcut) and locate the project directory (folder where your .arm file and textures will be saved)
- Select your object (needs to be unwrapped) and click on the `Open in ArmorPaint`
- When the texturing process is done, export your textures to a subdirectory called `exports`
